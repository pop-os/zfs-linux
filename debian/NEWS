zfs-linux (2.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  zfs-linux has now opted-in usr-merge. No behavioral changes should be noted.

  Some tools that do not require root privilege in zfsutils-linux have been
  moved from sbin to bin: arc_summary, zvol_wait, zilstat. Links are added in
  sbin to avoid breaking existing scripts. Users calling these binraies should
  update all absolute paths used.

  As an exception, the name /usr/bin/arcstat is taken by another different
  package, nordugrid-arc-client. Thus zfs-linux still uses /usr/sbin/arcstat.

zfs-linux (2.2.2-5~exp3) experimental; urgency=medium

  zfs-linux has now opted-in usr-merge. No behavioral changes should be noted.
  
  Some tools that do not require root privilege in zfsutils-linux have been
  moved from sbin to bin: arc_summary, arcstat, zvol_wait, zilstat.
  Symbolic links are added in sbin to keep compatibility. We encourage all
  users to update the paths in their own use cases, as the links might be
  removed in future versions.

  zfsutils-linux now conflicts with nordugrid-arc-client, since they both
  provide /usr/bin/arcstat.

zfs-linux (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The SIMD acceleration has been fixed in this upstream release.
  Users could use the following two commands to double check:

    $ cat /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_vdev_raidz_impl 
    $ cat /sys/module/zcommon/parameters/zfs_fletcher_4_impl

  Another notable change is the parallelization of the KABI checks
  during the configure stage, which may significantly boost the
  postinst stage of zfs-dkms that builds the kernel module.

      module is now included in the zfs-dkms package.
