zfs-linux (2.2.2-5~exp4) experimental; urgency=medium

  zfs-linux has now opted-in usr-merge. No behavioral changes should be noted.
  
  Some tools that do not require root privilege in zfsutils-linux have been
  moved from sbin to bin: arc_summary, zvol_wait, zilstat.
  All users should update the absolute paths used in their scripts.

  As a reminder, /usr/bin/arcstat is a different binary provided by another
  package, nordugrid-arc-client. Thus zfs-linux still use /usr/sbin/arcstat.

zfs-linux (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The SIMD acceleration has been fixed in this upstream release.
  Users could use the following two commands to double check:

    $ cat /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_vdev_raidz_impl 
    $ cat /sys/module/zcommon/parameters/zfs_fletcher_4_impl

  Another notable change is the parallelization of the KABI checks
  during the configure stage, which may significantly boost the
  postinst stage of zfs-dkms that builds the kernel module.
