Package: spl
Architecture: all
Suggests: zfs-test
Description: Solaris Porting Layer user-space utilities for Linux (dummy)
 The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which provides
 many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes it possible to
 run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with relatively minimal
 modification. The Solaris Porting LAyer Tests (SPLAT) is a Linux kernel
 module which provides a testing harness for the SPL module.
 .
 SPL can be particularly useful when you want to track upstream Illumos
 (or any other OpenSolaris fork) development closely and don't want the
 overhead of maintaining a large patch which converts Solaris primitives
 to Linux primitives.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package. It can safely be removed.
